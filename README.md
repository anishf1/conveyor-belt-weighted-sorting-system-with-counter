Conveyor Belt Weighted Sorting System with a LCD counter using Arduino &amp; FSR sensor

Collaborated with a team of 3 to engineer a conveyor belt sorting system designed to efficiently separate payloads between two different destinations based on their weight. Additionally, the system featured real-time payload counting, tracking those surpassing the predefined weight threshold and those falling below it. My roles in the group were:

Arduino Programming (C++)
Merge of coding
Testing on Breadboard
Servo motor implementation, coding and testing
Ultrasonic sensor implementation, coding and testing
Strain gauge (FSR) coding and testing
Simulations / Schematics

My main role was to program this system and make all the different motors work together. This meant implementing an innovative sensing solution utilizing Force-Sensing Resistor (FSR) technology, which interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller. This FSR sensor would trigger the activation of the conveyor belt motor and a servo mechanism upon detecting packages exceeding a specified weight which would direct them to their designated location. Finally, the amount of payloads in the different locations as well as the current weight of the payload on the FSR sensor was presented to the user on an LCD.
